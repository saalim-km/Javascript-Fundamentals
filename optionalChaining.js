//  Optional chaining is a feature in js that allows you to
//  access properties of an object or elements of an object or
//  elements of an array without having to check whether the object
//  or array is null or undefined first. It is reperesnted by the ?.
//  operator and can be used to concisely acces deeply nested properities
//  without having to write a long chain of if statement to check for null or undefined values.
